    <p>I'm a writer sharing short stories and poetry online.</p>
    <article>I write early mornings and late nights. You’ll find short fiction, a little non-fiction, and a dash of poetry.</article>
    <article>Hey there! Welcome and thanks for stopping by. I’m an aspiring writer and loving the process. Like most fledgling writers, I have half-finished novels and short stories hanging out in hard drives, tablets, journals and notebooks spread far and wide. I finally decided to get my act together and start finishing, editing and sharing my work.  Enjoy!</article>
